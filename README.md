# sbjobs

This project looks at different career websites of companies in Santa Barbara and scrapes the job listing.

The scraped data are available in the `joblistings` subdirectory and the source code is in `sbjobs` subdirectory.

Only has a few companies right now. Might add a few more if I find time (might also delete)
